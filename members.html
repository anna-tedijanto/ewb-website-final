I’m a freshman Biomedical Engineer from New Jersey and I love to run, row, and bake. Outside of Engineers Without Borders, I work in Concrete Canoe’s mix subteam and as a Society of Women Engineers outreach chair. When I’m not studying in the Uris Cocktail Lounge, you can find me exploring Cornell and Ithaca. Whether through hiking near (and sometimes through) the gorges, running with the Cornell Running Club, or just getting lost in buildings on campus or on streets in the Commons, I’m always finding new ways to explore and better get to know the community.<\/p>\n<p style='font-family:Proxima Nova'>Fun fact: I starred in a Clean & Clear commercial about my interest in science!<\/p>\n"};
